# MyReads App

React app for categorizing books that you might want to read, you are currently reading or you have already read.

Also has a simple searching features for adding new books to the collections.

Built on top of the [starter template](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter) for the final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course, developed by [React Training](https://reacttraining.com). 

## Quickstart

1. Clone/Download the repo
2. cd into the project root and run `npm install`
3. run `npm start`

`localhost:3000` should open in a browser tab/window

## Note on Searching feature

The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
